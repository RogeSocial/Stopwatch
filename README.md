# **Stopwatch**
## **Description**

We have created a stopwatch project since we go to school and want to get better at using JavaScript. This is nothing serious only for learning purposes. But we have created a stopwatch with the necessary functions such as start, stop and reset.

## **How to use the project**

Download the project and open the HTML file in a browser.
